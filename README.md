# The fellas.social Handles for Bluesky Service

A service which allows the NAFO Fellas to create their own [name].fellas.social handle for Bluesky.
Go to [https://fellas.social](https://fellas.social) to get your own!

## What is a community handle?

When you see posts in Bluesky, you'll notice that their 'handle' is normally [name].bsky.social. Most people keep this default handle, however you can change it to something else if you own a domain.

For example, if you owned a domain called [fellas.social](https:fellas.social), then you could set your handle as @fellas.social. However if you wanted more than one handle based on the same domain then you could create multiple sub-domains which might look like [@chrisrid.fellas.social](https://chrisrid.fellas.social), replacing the first username for each person in your community.

While doing this manually is an option for small numbers of people, it doesn't scale well with larger communities. That's where this service comes in, by automatically creating and allocating sub-domains through the website for people to use as handles.

## How do I get a fellas.social handle?

It's easy for fellas to get their own handle, simply go to [https://fellas.social](https://fellas.social) and follow the instructions.

## How can I contribute to this project?

If you're a fella who's great with web development and/or cyber-security, then reach out to [@chrisrid.fellas.social](https://chrisrid.fellas.social) on Bluesky. You can also help by suggesting ideas and improvements by reaching out in the same way - every fellas input is welcomed!

## How can I set something like this up for my own community?
